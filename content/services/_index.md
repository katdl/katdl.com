## Data Science Strategy

A strategic analysis project to identify data and processes where data science could have an impact, and produce a list of ranked POC options.

## Proof of Concept

We work with your organization to build one of those proof of concepts. This is a hands on project with material deliverables.

## Build and Train Team

Once we have a system running and doing what we want, we want to help you operationalize it with your own team.

## Long Term Support

As needed, customers can engage us to support the solutions we deliver.

## Custom Coding

We are expert software developers and have run large scale software projects deployed in different cloud and on premise environments. We have evaluated security and architecture for dozens of well known cloud forward internet companies, so we can help select technology and build an awesome solution.

We also have experience communicating about plans and priorities so that you always know about milestones, deadlines, costs and dates. We make sure to communicate what is going on so you can focus on the subject matter.
