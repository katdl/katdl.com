## Seamless collaboration with doctors, scientists, and academics

Even though we live in code and data, we have backgrounds in science and academics. We love working with subject experts on hard problems. See our [blog](/blog/) for some simple case studies and stories from our projects.

We are also entrepreneurs who know that getting the job done and done right is essential for mutual success and ultimately: **progress**.

## Coding Excellence

We are expert software developers and have run large scale software projects deployed in different cloud and on premise environments. We have evaluated security and architecture for dozens of well known cloud forward internet companies, so we can help select technology and build an awesome solution.

We also have experience communicating about plans and priorities so that you always know about milestones, deadlines, costs and dates. We make sure to communicate what is going on so you can focus on the subject matter.
