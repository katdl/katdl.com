# KAT Data Labs

## Develop

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To include future-dated posts:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --future --watch
```

Or use the `docker.sh` script to run the site in Docker.
